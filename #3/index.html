      <p class="body-text serif">They say that dating apps were created to make finding your next relationship easier. With so many different platforms to choose from (and plenty of members signed on), trying to find a match who's here for the right reasons can feel kind of impossible?</p>

According to the survey, 17 percent of respondents reported that they personally met their romantic partner through a dating website or app, while in comparison 40 percent of respondents reported otherwise, stating that neither them or anyone they knew met their romantic partner through such dating platforms.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif"><strong>Why do people use dating apps?</strong></h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">Most single people these days are on dating apps. But why? What are they searching for? Why do people use dating apps? Well, according to a new study by YouGov, the most common reason why is definitely not what most of us would expect. Even with all of the millions of "Tinderella" wedding hashtags clogging our newsfeeds these days, many of us still associate dating apps as being "just for hookups." But we couldn't be more wrong.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">The new study by YouGov found that 49 percent of adults who have ever used a dating app or site were on them to find an exclusive romantic partner. In other words, next time you're swiping through Bumble, you can rest assured that pretty much every other person you swipe on really is looking for an exclusive relationship.</p>
