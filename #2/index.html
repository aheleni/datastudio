      <p class="body-text serif"><strong>Athens, Greece.</strong>There have been a number of reports over the past 12 months about hate crimes being carried out against minorities in Greece, and now the numbers speak for themselves. According to statistics from the ODIHR, derived from the Hellenic Police, the number of hate crimes based on racism and xenophobia have more than doubled in 2017, jumping to 72 from 32 incidents in 2016.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Every year, ODIHR publishes data on hate crimes and hate incidents from participating States, civil society organizations and international organizations. These data are released on International Tolerance Day, which falls on 16 November.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Hate crimes are criminal acts motivated by bias or prejudice towards particular groups of people. To be considered a hate crime, the offence must meet two criteria. The first is that the act constitutes an offence under criminal law. Secondly, the act must have been motivated by bias.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Thirty-nine participating States have submitted some hate crime information to ODIHR for 2017. Of these, 34 provided statistics, while 23 provided statistics that are disaggregated by bias motivation.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif"><strong>Greece</strong></p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Greece regularly reports hate crime data to ODIHR. Greece's Criminal Code contains a general penalty-enhancement provision for hate crimes. The Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights, the Public Prosecutor's Office and the State Security headquarters of the Greek Police collect hate crime data. Hate crimes soared to 108 in 2017, according to the Hellenic Police's statistics. In 2016, police documented 35 such crimes.</p>
